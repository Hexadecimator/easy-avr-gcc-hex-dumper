# easy-avr-gcc-hex-dumper
Python frontend to streamline using avr-objdump

GCC has a utility that allows you to view machine-specific assembly code from GCC-generated object files. The Arduino IDE uses a specialized GCC toolchain called AVR-GCC. AVR-GCC includes a unique version of objdump called "avr-objdump". 

This Python tool will be built out and expanded over time to generate and view assembly code from AVR-GCC toolchain-generated files. This project is a learning vehicle for me.
